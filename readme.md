#Space Blitz

Space Blitz is a 2D vertical scroller space shooter game created during a weekend-long hackathon at Fullstack Academy. Shoot all the enemy spaceships and the big bad boss with your laser bullets before they destroy you!

A one-person project built using JavaScript, HTML5 and the utterly fun and addictive Phaser.io framework.
